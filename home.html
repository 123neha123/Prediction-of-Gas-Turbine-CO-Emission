<h1 class="text-center">Prediction of Gas Turbine CO</h1><br>
<h3 class="text-left">Description:</h3>
<p class="text-left">Predict the Gas Turbine CO Emission using 11 
    sensor measures aggregated over one hour (by means of average orsum) from a gas turbine 
    located in Turkey's north western region for the purpose of studying flue gas emissions,
    namely CO and NOx (NO + NO2)</p>

<h3 class="text-left">Motivation:</h3>
<p class="text-left"> Harmful effect of Flue gas emitted from power 
    plant turbines on environment has always been a substantial concern. 
    In the recent past years many peaceful protest to save environment has been seen. 
    Environmental organization that seeks to protect, analyse or monitor the environment 
    have conducted many events and activities to raise people awareness on environment. 
    This project aims to predict emission of flue gases based on sensor data from gas
     turbine and various Machine Learning techniques.</p>

    <p>ML model can be used to predict/estimate amount of emission 
    for future operations of Turbine and Turbine of same homologus series. 
    Model output can also be used for validation and backing up of costly continuous 
    emission monitoring systems used in gas-turbine-based power plants. 
    Their implementation relies on the availability of appropriate and ecologically valid data.</p><br>
